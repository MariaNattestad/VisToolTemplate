# Visualization tool template

This is a template for building visualization tools. 

It takes care of several requirements shared by most visualization tools on the web:
1. A system for getting input files from the user
2. Reading and parsing input files into the format that D3 can best use
3. A way to communicate error messages and other information to the user
4. Navigation bar with a page structure that works in this single-page app, with room for tutorials, citation information, and where to find the open-source code
5. An example D3 visualization to experiment with and replace with your own


index.html is the starting point and contains notes throughout for where to modify the template.
